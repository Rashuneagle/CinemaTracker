## Cinema Tracker

## Description

AS A user
I WANT to have a website where I can look for shows and movies
SO THAT I can store them and refer back to them.

## Installation

To utilize website
I go to the login page and "Sign Up" for an account by entering a username, email and password
or I can "Login" to my account if I already have an existing one.

## Usage

After I login to the website,
it takes me to the main page, the "Dashboard" screen showing the "Movies" and "Shows" tabs.
This website can be used to search for shows and movies, old and new
and add them to the users Dashboard.
